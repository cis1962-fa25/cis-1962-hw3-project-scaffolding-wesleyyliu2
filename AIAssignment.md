# Why AI
I used AI to help debug some of my problems after failing to find solutions to rather niche problems through normal search engines. I usually tried to debug my errors by either manually going through my code or searching up error messages online. Sometimes, I cannot find relevant results, and using AI helps guide me in the right direction. 

# AI Response
The AI's response about general string types vs. string literal types was extremely helpful. I was very lost at the difference between the two, and was having trouble finding conceptual information online that showed the difference. The explanation provided by the AI was concise and solidified my understanding. It did not hallucinate details, and I accepted the response fully for the "as const" part in my code. 

I learned that in TypeScript, "as const" makes variables read-only, making the type conversion more narrow than usual.
